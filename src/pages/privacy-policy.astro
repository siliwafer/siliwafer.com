    <ul>
      <li>

    <p>
      <strong>In Short:&nbsp;</strong>If you choose to register or log in to our
      Services using a social media account, we may have access to certain
      information about you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your
      third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or Twitter
      logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile
      information about you from your social media provider. The profile
      information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider
      concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends list,
      and profile picture, as well as other information you choose to make
      public on such a social media platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are
      described in this privacy notice or that are otherwise made clear to you
      on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are not
      responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your
      third-party social media provider. We recommend that you review their
      privacy notice to understand how they collect, use, and share your
      personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on
      their sites and apps.

      <strong>In Short:&nbsp;</strong>We keep your information for as long as
      necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless
      otherwise required by law.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary
      for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention
      period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other
      legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping
      your personal information for longer than the period of time in which
      users have an account with us.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal
      information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if
      this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has
      been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal
      information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is
      possible.

      <strong>In Short:&nbsp;</strong>We aim to protect your personal
      information through a system of organizational and technical security
      measures.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and
      organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any
      personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and
      efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the
      Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100%
      secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or
      other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security
      and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information.
      Although we will do our best to protect your personal information,
      transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your
      own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.

    </p>
    <p>Verification process</p>
    <p>
      Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to
      determine you are the same person about whom we have the information in
      our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide
      information so that we can match it with information you have previously
      provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we
      may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the
      information you provide with the information we already have on file, or
      we may contact you through a communication method (e.g., phone or email)
      that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other
      verification methods as the circumstances dictate.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify
      your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we
      will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of
      verification. However, if we cannot verify your identity from the
      information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide
      additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity and for
      security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally
      provided information as soon as we finish verifying you.
    </p>
    <p>Other privacy rights</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You may object to the processing of your personal information.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You may request correction of your personal data if it is incorrect or
        no longer relevant, or ask to restrict the processing of the
        information.

    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You can designate an authorized agent to make a request under the CCPA

        not submit proof that they have been validly authorized to act on your
        behalf in accordance with the CCPA.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You may request to opt out from future selling or sharing of your
        personal information to third parties. Upon receiving an opt-out
        request, we will act upon the request as soon as feasibly possible, but
        no later than fifteen (15) days from the date of the request submission.
